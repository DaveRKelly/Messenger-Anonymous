## FAQs
### Can it message any friend?
No, only friends who are also using MessengerAnonymous.

### Why did I have to authorize an application when starting?
Facebook doesn't give Messenger bots permissions to look at friend lists by default, so we have to request the extra permission. We are only able to look at friends who have also signed up for MessengerAnonymous.

### Can I send images?
Yes. GIF away
